deepface-react-ui is a comprehensive user interface for facial recognition built with ReactJS, designed specifically for streamlined face verification tasks using the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library. This UI not only simplifies the implementation of facial recognition features but also enhances security with built-in [anti-spoofing](https://youtu.be/UiK1aIjOBlQ) capabilities. Whether you're working on identity verification systems, security applications, or simply exploring facial recognition technology, this UI provides an intuitive platform to harness the power of DeepFace within your web applications.

Facial recognition technology plays a pivotal role in modern applications, from enhancing security measures to enabling personalized user experiences. The deepface-react-ui empowers developers and researchers to harness these capabilities effortlessly within their web applications.

## Configuration

There is `.env.example` file in the root of the project. You should copy this as `.env`. Required modifications are mentioned as comments.

```yaml
# backend deepface service's endpoint, do not change if not necessary
REACT_APP_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5005

# Set FR model: VGG-Face, Facenet, Facenet512, OpenFace, DeepFace, DeepId, ArcFace, Dlib, SFace, GhostFaceNet
REACT_APP_FACE_RECOGNITION_MODEL=Facenet

# Set face detector: opencv, ssd, mtcnn, dlib, mediapipe, retinaface, yolov8, yunet, centerface
REACT_APP_DETECTOR_BACKEND=opencv

# Set distance metric: cosine, euclidean, euclidean_l2
REACT_APP_DISTANCE_METRIC=cosine

# Set REACT_APP_ANTI_SPOOFING to 1 if you want to enable anti-spoofing
REACT_APP_ANTI_SPOOFING=0

# define your facial database. keys are names with REACT_APP_USER_ prefix and values are base64 encoded strings
REACT_APP_USER_ALICE=data:image/png;base64,...
REACT_APP_USER_BOB=data:image/png;base64,...
REACT_APP_USER_CAROL=data:image/png;base64,...
```

## Running Service

Firstly, you have to run the deepface service.

```shell
# clone deepface repo
git clone git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface.git

# go to project's directory
cd deepface/scripts

# run the dockerized service
./dockerize.sh

# or instead of running dockerized service, run it directly if you installed requirements.txt
# ./service.sh
```

In seperate terminal, you should run deepface react ui

```shell
# clone deepface react ui repo
git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface-react-ui.git

# go to project's directory
cd deepface-react-ui/scripts

# run the dockerized service
./dockerize.sh

# or instead of running dockerized service, run it directly
# ./service.sh
```

## Running via Docker Compose

Instead of running deepface and deepface react ui seperately in different terminals, you can run the standalone docker compose.

```shell
# clone source code
git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface-react-ui.git && git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface.git

# go to project's directory
cd deepface-react-ui/scripts

# run services
./compose.sh
```

# Using The App

Once you start the service, the DeepFace service will be accessible at `http://localhost:5005/`, and the DeepFace React UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

To use the DeepFace React UI, open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. The UI will prompt access to your webcam and search for identities within the current frame using the facial database specified in the `.env` file when you click on the "Verify" button.
